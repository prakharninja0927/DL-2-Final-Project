# Pedestrian Vehicle Detection with YOLOv5 and Streamlit

This repository contains code for performing pedestrian and vehicle detection using YOLOv5 and integrating it with Streamlit for easy deployment and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- OpenCV
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Streamlit

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python pillow streamlit
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Once the app is running, you can upload an image containing pedestrians and vehicles for detection.

## Description

- The `app.py` script contains the Streamlit application code for object detection.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists all the required Python packages and their versions.
